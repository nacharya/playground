Software Playground using Containers 

- A base Microservice container that 
    - A backend WebService based on `golang`
        - that interacts with Cloud services AWS and Azure 
    - A low level I/O, Compute and Networking layer based on `rust`
- Any interaction with any other microservices is only via 
  a REST API served

- This microservice is a lot more based on interactions with other
  stateful services , and other low level system semantics
